# 1.03 First Windows implementation as a YAC Server instead
#      Added option to ignore a phone number since Vonage is sending an invite packet for Outgoing calls as well
#      Commented out all Unix things for now
#      Use WinPcap to enable sniffing
# 1.04 Implemented use of Windows Syslog (Event Viewer)
#      Since Windows has no POSIX interface, it is not possible to fork() (correctly), removed Daemon option
#      Cleaned up print outs
#      by Kevin Jacobson (for v1.03+)
# 1.05 Defined dependant Windows Services hooks
#      Started building exe with Windows Service support
#      Cleaned up Help output
#      Further cleanup of Logging
# 1.06 Changed default sniff port to 5060 to be compliant with more SIP services
#      Changed to only write to the Windows Event log when running as a service
#      Further cleanup of the Help text
#      Set Pcap to only compile the filter if a filter has been set, else just loop through all traffic
#      Changed Help text to use double-quotes to set the Pcap filter, else we set a unterminated string value that causes the script to throw-up
# 1.07 Setup a "fake" fork() to allow the service to start as a parent, spawn child, and poll child and no longer be in a loop so as to catch the STOP from Windows Service control
# 1.08 Should see an 11 digit phone number incoming from the SIP provider and reformat to a 10 digit formatted number
#      Set listener timeout to 5 seconds so the program doesn't wait forever if a listener is off
#      Strip any single or double quotes from the filter string to keep the argument reader from getting confused
# 1.09 Added additional error checking
#      Fixed YAC listener message sending and added sucess/fail debug messages
# 1.10 Added reverse lookup for VoIP systems that do not receive CNAM/CIDNAME
#      Reverse Lookup Code from: http://www.teamforrest.com/blog/89/using-agi-to-get-caller-id-name-cnam/
